Blessed is the L–rd, the G–d of Israel, who has separated us from all the peoples and given us His Torah and brought us to the holy land so that we merit fulfilling all of His mitzvoth. His sole intent was for our good alone, so that through this we become holy unto Him — viz. (Numbers 15:40): "So that you remember and do all of My mitzvoth and be holy unto your G–d" — and so that it be in our power to receive the effluence of His good and the abundance of His lovingkindness in this world and in the world to come, as it is written (Devarim 10:12- 13): "What does the L–rd your G–d ask of you, but… to keep the mitzvoth of the L–rd and His statutes which I command you this day to do good unto you?" (See the Ramban there to the effect that "to do good unto you" reverts to "What does the L–rd your G–d ask of you.")

And not only has He given us His special treasure, but He has also commanded us not to forsake it, as it is written (Mishlei 4:2): "For a goodly acquisition have I given you; do not forsake My Torah" — unlike the way of flesh and blood, who, if he gives his friend a fine gift, and the other does not deport himself with it correctly, and it is not beloved in his eyes, he pines for the day that his friend will abandon it altogether, so that he can take it back for himself. Not so is the way of our G–d. For He established for us prophets in all the generations of the first Temple to return us to the good. And even in the days of the second Temple, when (in our many sins) Israel descended from its pristine holiness, and when they lacked five things which obtained in the first Temple [ark, ark-cover, and cherubim; the Heavenly fire; the Shechinah; prophecy; and the urim vetumim (viz. Yoma 21b)] — notwithstanding this, when we were on our land and had a Temple, we could fulfill all the mitzvoth of the Torah, and thereby bring to perfection all of the spiritual components within us (the soul [like the body] possessing 248 "organs" and 365 "sinews" [see Sha'arei Kedushah of R. Chaim Vital, Chapter One]).

But in the end of the days of the Second Temple, sinath chinam [vain hatred] and lashon hara [slander] increased among us (in our many sins), for which reason the Temple was destroyed and we were exiled from our land (viz. Yoma 9b and Yerushalmi 1:5). [Though the Gemara calls it "sinath chinam," lashon hara is included, proceeding, as it does, from sinah. If this were not the case, they would not have been punished so severely; as the Gemara there concludes: "This is to teach you that sinath chinam is equivalent to idolatry, illicit relations, and the spilling of blood." And we find the same in Arachin 15b in respect to lashan hara, and, likewise, in the discussion in Yoma itself (viz. 9b and 23a).] And from then until now, every day, we hope and pray before the Holy One Blessed be He that He draw us near [to Him], as He assured us in His holy Torah and through His prophets many times. But our prayer is not accepted by Him, as Chazal [our sages of blessed memory] have said (Berachoth 32b): "From the day of the destruction of the Temple, a wall of iron separates Israel from their Father in heaven."

And, in truth, not against Him (G–d forbid) is our plaint, but against ourselves; for it [the redemption] is not beyond His powers, viz. (Isaiah 59:1-2): "Behold, the L–rd's hand is not too short to save, and His ear is not too heavy to hear. But your sins have made a separation between you and your G–d, and your transgressions have hid [His] face from you, from hearing." And we find (viz. Sanhedrin 98a) that in the days of R. Yehoshua ben Levi he was told (viz. Tehillim 95:6) that the Messiah would come "today, if you hearkened to His voice" — even though the time of the exile decreed for Israel (one thousand years, corresponding to the one thousand year "day" of the Holy One Blessed be He, had not yet passed [viz. Chida, Petach Eiynayim, Sanhedrin, Ibid.]) In spite of this, the power of repentance would have annulled the decree. How much more so, more than eight hundred years after the end of that [one-thousand-year] "day", [should the Messiah come if we repented]! The fault is ours alone — that with our many sins we do not allow Him to repose His Shechinah in our midst.

And if we carefully searched our ways — which of the sins have primarily caused the length of our exile? — we would find them to be many; but the sin of lashon hara above all, for several reasons. First, for it was the major cause of our exile (as related in the aforementioned Gemaroth). This being so, as long as we do not undertake to correct this sin, how can there be a redemption, the sin being so severe as to have caused us to be exiled from our land! How much more so will it not allow us to return to our land!

Furthermore, is it not well known that exile had already been decreed upon us because of the act of the spies (viz. Tehillim 106:25-27): "And they murmured in their tents [against the land]. They hearkened not to the voice of the L–rd. And He lifted up His hand [in oath] against them… to scatter them in the lands," as Rashi and the Ramban explain there (Bamidbar 14). And the sin of the spies — was it not that of lashon hara! (viz. Arachin 15a). Therefore, it is imperative that we correct this sin before the redemption can take place.

And we find it explicitly stated that it was this sin which caused the Jews to be worked [by the Egyptians] with back-breaking labor (viz. Shemoth 2:14 and Rashi there). And (Devarim Rabbah 6:14): "The Holy One Blessed be He said: 'In this world, because there was lashon hara among you, I removed My Shechinah from you, but in the next world, etc.'" And (Devarim 33:5): "And He became a King in Yeshurun when the heads of the people were gathered together as one, the tribes of Israel," which Rashi interprets (as per Sifrei): "When is He a King in Israel? Specifically, when the tribes of Israel are united and not divided into factions" — which (factions) are well known to be the result of lashon hara.

And, aside from this, how can the hoped-for blessings of the Holy One Blessed be He repose upon us when, in our many sins, we have become habituated to this sin? Is there not an explicit curse on this in the Torah, viz. (Devarim 27:24): "Cursed is he who strikes his neighbor in secret," which refers to lashon hara, as Rashi explains there (aside from the other curses which are superadded to this, as will be shown at the end of this preface)?

In addition, is it not seen from the aforementioned Gemara in Arachin that this sin is of infinite severity, so much so that they have branded its practitioners as heretics! And in Yerushalmi Peah 1:1, it is stated that punishment is exacted for this sin in this world, with the "principal" remaining (for punishment) in the world to come!

And it seems clear that the Torah was severe with this sin because he [the speaker of lashon hara] arouses the Great Adversary against Israel and thereby kills many people in many lands. Consider the language of the holy Zohar in (Shemoth) Pekudei 264b: "There is a certain spirit appointed over all these speakers of lashon hara, which, when men are aroused to lashon hara, there is likewise aroused that malevolent, unclean spirit above, which is called sachsusa ["contention"]. Presiding over that arousal of lashon hara initiated by men, he rises on high and causes — by that arousal of lashon hara — death, sword, and slaughter in the world. Woe unto those who arouse this malevolent force by not guarding their mouth and their tongue, giving no thought to it, not knowing that on this lower arousal depends the higher arousal, both for good and for evil. And all of them arouse this Great Serpent to be an adversary against the world. And all this, because of the lashon hara arousal initiated below."

And we can say that this is the intent of the aforementioned Gemara in Arachin, viz.: "All who speak lashon hara magnify transgression until the heavens, as it is written (Tehillim 73:9): 'They set their mouth in the heavens, and their tongue walks the earth.'" That is, even though his tongue walks the earth, he sets his mouth against Heaven. And thus do we find it in Tanna d'bei Eliyahu (Rabbah Zuta 18) — that the lashon hara that he speaks rises against the Throne of Glory. We can hereby derive some idea of the greatness of the destruction wrought against Israel by the "men of the tongue."  
And when we delve more deeply into this matter, we find that in addition to its being a grave transgression in itself, it undermines all the [upper] worlds and darkens and lessens their light. For it is the habit of many men to redouble [violation of] this negative commandment many hundreds of times in the course of their lives. For even a small sin, when it is repeated many times, becomes like [thick] cart-ropes, as Isaiah exhorted (Isaiah 5:18): "Woe unto those who draw forth iniquity with cords of deceit and [who draw forth] sin as [thick as] cart-ropes." This is analogous to the instance of a silken strand which is redoubled hundreds of times. How much more so is this sin [of lashon hara], which is extremely grave in itself and which countless men tend to repeat many thousands of times in the course of their lives without taking it upon themselves to guard themselves against it — how much more so is the [corresponding] undermining [of the worlds] above without limit!  
And I sought to understand this: Why is it that this negative commandment has become insignificant in the eyes of so many men? And I reflected that this must be so for several reasons, [affecting] the common people on one hand and the [Torah] scholars on the other. The common people do not even know that the prohibition of lashon hara applies to what is true [as well as to what is untrue]; and the Torah scholars, even though they know for a certainty that it applies to what is true as well — some of them are misled by the yetzer hara [the evil inclination] in a variety of ways. One of these: The yetzer hara puts it immediately into his head that the one he is speaking of is a flatterer, and says to him: "It is a mitzvah to expose the flatterers and the evil-doers." At other times it says to him: "Isn't that man [you are speaking of] a stirrer-up of strife, about whom it is permitted to speak lashon hara?" And sometimes it tempts him with the [halachic] permit of apei telata [lashon hara spoken in the presence of three], and, sometimes, of apei mara [convincing him that he would speak thus even to his (the victim's) face]. And the yetzer hara provides him with the relevant citations (see below, Principles II, III, and VIII). And sometimes he appeals to the nature of what is being said, i.e., that it is not in the category of lashon hara (e.g., what many, in our many sins, are prone to do), publicizing one as not being wise (as will be explained in Principle III).  
In sum, the yetzer hara [in respect to lashon hara] acts in one of two ways: It convinces the speaker that what he says is not lashon hara, or that the Torah did not forbid speaking lashon hara against such and such a man.  
And if the yetzer hara sees that in these ways he cannot prevail over the man, he deceives him in reverse, being so stringent with him in the area of lashon hara until he sees everything as entering into the category of lashon hara, to the extent that he sees it as impossible to live life thus constrained unless he separates entirely from the affairs of the world — as per the device of the [primal] subtle serpent, who said [to Eve] (Genesis 3:1): "Did G–d really say do not eat from all the trees of the garden"? [(when, in reality, he had interdicted only the Tree of Knowledge)]  
Add to this that many men lack a fundamental understanding of the prohibition of receiving lashon hara — that it applies even to believing it in the heart [and not only to repeating it (though one is permitted to "suspect" it to be true, viz. Niddah 61a)]. The same is true of many similar instances in the area of receiving lashon hara and of rechiluth [talebearing], which cannot be specified here. And they also do not know how to make amends if they have transgressed the prohibition of speaking lashon hara and of receiving it.  
Because of these reasons things have come to such a pass that one says whatever enters his mouth to say, without first considering that it might enter the category of rechiluth and lashon hara. (In our many sins), we have become so habituated to this sin that in the eyes of many men it is not considered a sin at all — even if he would say something which is apparent to everyone as absolute lashon hara and rechiluth, as when he would speak of his friend and demean him to the very ends of degradation. And if one asked him: "Why did you speak lashon hara and rechiluth?" he would think in his heart that he [his chastiser] thought to make him a ["fanatic"] tzaddik or chasid, and he would not accept his words at all, regarding this [(lashon hara and rechiluth)], in our many sins, as completely insignificant.  
And all this proceeds — for the most part — from the laws of lashon hara and rechiluth not having been gathered into one spot, where there could be elucidated their nature and application, in principle and in practice. Instead, they are scattered in the Talmud and in the Rishonim (the early authorities). And even the Rambam in the seventh chapter of Hilchoth Deoth and Rabbeinu Yonah in the Sha'arei Teshuvah, who have paved the way for us in this area, have, nonetheless, been very terse, as is the way of the Rishonim. And there are also many dinim [laws] that are not mentioned in their words, as will be seen within.  
And let the reader, my brother, know that for even the simplest thing found therein, I have indicated its source in the Be'er Mayim Chayim, so that it be clear before the eyes of all that I have not written this book according to the parameters of chasiduth [saintliness], but according to the parameters of din [Law].  
For the din flows from them [these sources]. "And all who judge me by the scales of merit, may the Source [of life] judge them by the scales of merit." I have also written for this book a long, extensive foreword, explicating several negative and positive commandments frequently transgressed by those who do not guard themselves against this bitter sin of lashon hara and rechiluth. May the L–rd grant that the yetzer be smitten, when he [the transgressor] realizes the extent of the havoc and the harm wrought by his speech.  
Aside from this, the following (Midrash Rabbah 14:4) is well known: "If you have labored much in their [the sages'] words, the Holy One Blessed be He removes the yetzer hara from you" — whereupon I said to myself: "Possibly, if they study this book, which is gathered from all the words of the Rishonim on this subject, and reflect upon them, the yetzer hara for this sin will not prevail so much over them." And, as a mater of course, if one starts to remove himself from this sin, he will come to remove himself from it entirely. For in this sin, habit plays a great part, and (Yoma 38b) "One who comes to purify himself is assisted [by the L–rd]." And in this merit, may the Redeemer [the Messiah] come to Zion," (Isaiah 50:29), speedily, in our days, Amen!  
In the Blessed One's love for His people Israel and His great desire for their good — to the point of calling them "sons," and "the portion of the L–rd," and "inheritance," along with many other terms of affection which show His great love for Israel, viz. (Malachi 1:2): "I have loved You, said the L–rd, etc.," He distanced them from all forms of evil, especially from lashon hara and rechiluth. For it is these which bring men to quarrels and contention and which very often can lead to the spilling of blood, as the Rambam wrote (Hilchoth Deoth 4:1): "Even though there are no malkoth [stripes] for transgression of this negative commandment, it is a great sin, which leads to the killing of many souls in Israel, for which reason it [i.e., 'Do not go tale bearing among your people' (Vayikra 19:16) is followed by: 'Do not stand (idly) by the blood of your brother' — as evidenced by [the episode of] Doeg Ha'adomi and Nov, the city of priests (viz. I Samuel 22:9)."  
Some additional great evils brought about by this despicable trait: It is well known that the sin of the [primal] serpent was brought about by the lashon hara that it spoke against the Holy One Blessed be He, saying [to Eve]: "He [G–d] ate from this tree [the Tree of Knowledge] and created the world," by which Eve was enticed to do likewise (viz. Shabbath 146a): "The serpent was 'intimate' with Eve and injected zuhamah ['pollution'] into her" — hence, [(the sin of) illicit relations], and also death to all mankind — hence, the spilling of blood. And through this [i.e., lashon hara] it induced Adam and Eve to transgress the will of the Holy One Blessed be He. It follows that one who speaks lashon hara adopts its [the serpent's] trait, which undermines the creation.  
And the descent of Israel into Egypt, too, stemmed initially from this [i.e., from lashon hara], viz. (Bereshith 37:2): "And Joseph brought evil report of them [the sons of Leah] to their father," whence it was decreed by Heaven, measure for measure, that he be sold into slavery, his having accused them of calling their brothers [from the maidservants] "slaves" (viz. Bereshith Rabbah 84:7 and Yerushalmi Peah 1:1). Though Joseph had a heter [halachic license] for bringing this "evil report," as the exegetes explain, it is to be noted that this heter did not avail him [and he was sold into slavery]. 
And again, the entire reason for our present exile is the sin of the spies (viz. Tehillim 6:25-27): "And they murmured in their tents [against the land]. They hearkened not to the word of the L–rd. And He lifted up His hand [in oath] against them… to scatter them in the lands," as Rashi explains there and as the Ramban wrote (on Bamidbar 14:1). And it is stated in Arachin (15a) that the sin of the spies was essentially lashon hara, their giving out an evil report of the land. And because they then (on the eve of the ninth of Av) cried a "vain" cry, it (the ninth of Av) was decreed for them as a "crying" for the generations [e.g., the destruction of both Temples, etc.]. And countless other evils befell us because of this grave sin. For all the sages of Israel who were killed by King Yannai in the days of Shimon ben Shetach, the brother-in-law of King Yannai, were also killed because of the sin of rechiluth (viz. Kiddushin 66a). And the murder of the tanna, R. Elazar Hamodai, (which also contributed to the destruction of Betar) was likewise caused by rechiluth which was spoken against him before Ben Koziva (viz. Eichah Rabbah 2:4).  
And because of the gravity of the evils found in this evil trait, the Torah exhorted us specifically against it by negative commandment, viz. (Vayikra 19:16): "Do not go talebearing among your people," as shall be explained below (as opposed to anger, cruelty, and levity and the other corrupt traits, which even though they undermine the majesty of the soul and its form, and they were alluded to in many places in the Torah, as explained in the words of Chazal — with all this, there is no explicit negative commandment against them [as there is against rechiluth] in the count of taryag [the 613 commandments] of the Torah.  
And we shall note yet another reason for the Torah's exhorting us explicitly against these — lashon hara and rechiluth. For when we analyze them in truth, we find them to include almost all the negative and positive commandments which obtain between a man and his neighbor and many between a man and his Maker, as we shall explain, G–d willing. It is for this reason that the Torah exhorted us against these explicitly, so that we not become enmeshed in this evil snare. I shall explain this with the help of the Blessed One. And from this there shall follow, incidentally, great benefit vis-à-vis many other halachoth. And also, perhaps, because of this, the yetzer will be smitten when he [the transgressor] perceives the great havoc and harm wrought by his speech. And here I begin, with the help of Him who grants a man knowledge.  
First we must know the principles of these halachoth of lashon hara and rechiluth. ("Lashon hara" is speaking disparagingly against one's friend, and "rechiluth," telling one the evil thing that his friend has spoken against him or done against him.) [The principles]: It [lashon hara and rechiluth] is forbidden even if true, as will be explained below, please G–d, in the name of all the poskim. Also, the prohibition of lashon hara and rechiluth applies both in his [the object's] presence and not in his presence. Also, there is no difference between speaking and receiving [lashon hara and rechiluth], all of which we shall explain further. A "receiver" of lashon hara is one who believes in his heart what is told him by his friend even if he does not abet him in the telling but only believes in his heart the lashon hara and rechiluth that he has heard. If he does believe it, he is called "the bearer of a false report" and transgresses (Shemoth 23:1): "Do not bear a false report." All of these principles have roots and branches, as in the other parts of the Torah. May the L–rd grant that we know them comprehensively.  
And know that whenever we write that he transgresses both the negative and the positive commandments and the three "curses" attaching to them, which we shall mention and elucidate below, our intent is both lashon hara and rechiluth, and both what is false and what is true. And this is what we shall refer to in the Be'er Mayim Chayim as "in the first four modes" (unless we explicitly state that it applies only in one of them). And it shall then remain necessary for us only to explain in respect to all of the negative or positive commandments whether they apply in his [the object's presence or not in his presence, or to the speaker or to the receiver.  
And those negative or positive commandments which include all of the modes, I shall refer to, in short, in the Be'er Mayim Chaim as "in all the eight modes" — that is: lashon hara and rechiluth, in his presence or not in his presence, both to the speaker and to the receiver, and both if false or if true. (Remember these things, for I will not reiterate them in the introduction.)  
First we shall explain how many negative commandments one transgresses in the speaking of lashon hara and rechiluth, and then, how many positive commandments. Then, how many "curses" he brings upon himself, and, further, how many great issurim [prohibitions] result from this.  
I shall divide this introduction into two parts; the first, to be called "Makor Chaim," and a supercommentary around it called "Be'er Mayim Chayim." The reason for these names I have given in the preface. In the Be'er Mayim Chayim it will be made clear to which mode each negative or positive commandment applies, along with some other halachoth. This I begin with the help of Him who grants a man knowledge.

1) One who bears tales against his friend transgresses a negative commandment, viz. (Vayikra 19:16): "Do not go talebearing among your people." What is talebearing? "Loading oneself" with words and going from one to another, saying: "This is what ploni [so and so] said about you"; "This and this is what I heard ploni did to you." Although what he says may be true, it destroys the world. And there is a sin much greater than this — lashon hara, which is included in this negative commandment. And that is speaking disparagingly of one's friend, even if what is said is true. But one who speaks falsely [about his friend] is referred to as a "motzi shem ra" [one who spreads an evil report].
2) And the speaker or the receiver [of lashon hara] also transgresses (Shemoth 23:1): "Do not receive [tissa] a false report," which can also be read as: "Do not spread [tassi] a false report," so that this negative commandment includes both [the speaker and the receiver].
3) And the speaker also transgresses (Devarim 24:8): "Be heedful of the plague-spot of leprosy to take great care," which Sifra (1:3) interprets as [Take great care] not to forget to be heedful of lashon hara so that leprosy not come upon you [as it came upon Miriam for speaking lashon hara against Moses].
4) And both the speaker and the receiver transgress (Vayikra 19:14): "And before the blind man do not place a stumbling-block"; for each one [i.e., both the speaker and the listener] places a stumbling-block before his friend to transgress explicit negative commandments in the Torah. But there is a difference between the speaker and the listener in this regard. For the speaker transgresses this negative commandment both whether the listeners are many or few. Even more so, the more the listeners, the more he [the speaker] transgresses this negative commandment, placing a stumbling-block before many people. Not so the receiver. It is possible that he does not transgress this negative commandment unless he himself hears the lashon hara or the rechiluth from him [the speaker] at the moment, so that if he had left him, he would have no one to relate his lashon hara to. But if there are, besides him, different listeners at the time, it is possible that the hearer does not transgress this negative commandment, but only others mentioned in this introduction [see Be'er Mayim Chayim]. And all this, if he came after the "recital" had started. But the first listener — even though others arrived afterwards — certainly transgresses in all eight modes, for the issur was initiated through him. In any event, one must take great heed of such companions, not to sit with them; for "above" they are all inscribed as "a company of wickedness." And thus is it found in the will of R. Eliezer Hagadol to Hyrcanus, his son: "My son, do not sit with the companies of those who speak ill of their friends, for when their words rise on high, they are inscribed in a book, and all who stand there are described as "a wicked company."
5) And the speaker of lashon hara also transgresses (Devarim 8:11): "Take heed unto yourself lest you forget the L–rd your G–d," which is an exhortation to the proud of spirit, for since he mocks and ridicules his friend, he apparently considers himself wise and "a man among men." For if he knew his own faults, he would not deride his friend. And the statement of Chazal in Sotah (4b) on the severity of the sin of pride is well known, viz.: Because of it his dust does not wake for the resurrection, he is considered an idolator, the Shechinah wails over him, and he is called "an abomination." And, especially, if in shaming his friend he honors himself, he certainly transgresses this negative commandment, aside from our Rabbis' (in their holy spirit) having "cut him off" from the world to come, saying (Yerushalmi Chagigah 12:1): "One who honors himself by the shame of his friend has no share in the world to come."
6) The speaker and the receiver [of lashon hara] also transgress (Vayikra 22:32): "And you shall not profane My holy name," in that there is no lust or physical pleasure to cause his yetzer to intensify itself over him, so that this sin is regarded as rebellion and blatant divesting oneself of the yoke of Heaven; and he profanes the name of Heaven thereby. This, even in the instance of a plain Jew; how much more so in the instance of a man of eminence, whom they all look up to for guidance [speaking lashon hara], where the name of Heaven is certainly profaned! And how much more so, if this sin were committed in public, would it be extremely grave, the transgressor being called "a desecrator of the name of G–d in public."
7) And sometimes the speaker transgresses (Leviticus 19:17): "You shall not hate your brother in your heart," as when he "speaks peace" with his friend in his presence, and denigrates him before others when he is not in his presence. And much more [does he transgress] if he explicitly charges them not to go and inform him, in which instance he, of a certainty, transgresses this negative commandment.
8-9) Sometimes the speaker also transgresses (Vayikra 19:18): "You shall not take revenge and you shall not bear a grudge, as when he [the speaker] bears hatred towards him, having asked him to lend him something and having been denied; and, thereafter, seeing something demeaning in him, he publicizes it before others. From the beginning, he transgresses "You shall not bear a grudge," by bearing the grudge in his heart. And later, when he takes revenge and reveals the demeaning thing he has seen in him, he transgresses "You shall not take revenge." But he must wipe the thing from his heart! (10) And if one arises and testifies against another by himself before beth-din concerning something forbidden, since no benefit can result from this vis-à-vis monetary [obligations, imposition of] an oath, or invalidation of the other's status of kashruth [halachic fitness] since he is only a single witness in the matter, the only thing he "accomplishes" by this is giving the other a bad name, and he also transgresses the negative commandment of (Devarim 19:15): "One witness shall not testify against a man for every transgression and for every sin," and beth-din must punish him with stripes for this.  (11) And all this that we have written applies to one who speaks singly or who listens singly, but if he joins himself to a company of wicked men and speakers of lashon hara to tell them or to listen to them, he also transgresses (Shemoth 23:2): "Do not incline after many for evil," which is an exhortation not to agree with or even join with evildoers, though they be many. (And see further, Positive Commandment 6, where you will see that he also transgresses a positive commandment by this evil "joining." And see above (Negative Commandment 4) where I have cited Pirkei d'R. Eliezer on his [R. Eliezer Hagadol's] will to his son in this regard.  (12) And if he nurtures a quarrel in his speaking, he transgresses (Bamidbar 17:5). "And he shall not be as Korach and as his congregation," which is an exhortation against nurturing a quarrel (viz. Sanhedrin 110a).  (13) And many times another negative commandment is transgressed. For very often one's friend is demeaned for his early deeds, for a family trait, for the paucity of his learning, or for his [mediocre] work, each man according to his situation, things being said to him which anger and confound him and against which he has no defense. Even if this transpired between the two of them alone [no one else being present], he [the speaker] transgresses (Vayikra 25:17): "And you shall not wrong, one man his fellow," which refers to verbal wronging (viz. Bava Metzia 58b). How much more so if this occurred in the company of others! It emerges, then, that if one slights his friend both through rechiluth or through lashon hara, before him alone or before others, aside from transgressing the negative commandment of lashon hara and rechiluth, as stated above, he also transgresses this negative commandment.  (14) And if he demeans another thus, with such words and the like, before him [alone] and before others, to the extent that his face changes color [with shame], he transgresses also (Vayikra 19:17): ["Reprove, reprove, your fellow and] do not bear sin because of him." The Torah exhorted one hereby not to shame his fellow Jew, even for the sake of reproof and [even] between him and the other [alone]. That is, not to speak so sharply to him that he shames him — How much more so [i.e., should he not do so], if not for the sake of reproof and if he is in the presence of others. And all this, if it did not take place in public, but if he "whitens" his face [with shame] in public, Chazal have already "cut him off" from the world to come, saying (Bava Metzia 59a): "One who whitens his friend's face in public has no share in the world to come."  (15) And if the other were an orphan or a widow, even if they were wealthy, and he spoke demeaningly before them, he also transgresses (Shemoth 22:21): "Every widow and orphan you shall not afflict," the Torah exhorting hereby not to taunt them or sadden their heart with any kind of sorrow. The punishment for this is explicit in the Torah (Ibid 23): "And My wrath shall burn, and I shall kill you by the sword, and your wives will be widows, and your children, orphans."  (16) And sometimes he transgresses also the issur of flattery, which is to many Geonim (e.g., HaRe'em, Baal Hatosfoth, and Hagaon R. Shlomoh ben G'virol) an absolute negative commandment, (viz. Bamidbar 35:33): "And you shall not flatter [the men of] the land." That is, if his intent in speaking lashon hara and rechiluth is to flatter the listener, whom he knows to bear hatred to the one spoken about, and thereby, to find favor in his eyes — an egregious sin — is it not enough that he does not fulfill the mitzvah of reproof (a positive commandment in the Torah), to reprove him for the hatred he bears his friend, that he also strengthens the hatred that already exists among them! And through him [the speaker], he [the listener] will persist in his wrong more and more, so that more quarrels and wrongs will result (G–d forbid)! 
And know that this [the following] sin (in our many sins) is widespread. That is, when one speaks demeaningly of his friend, (often,) the listener, knowing that what is being said is unfounded, nevertheless nods his head [in agreement] and he, too, "smoothes over" the thing with his tongue, adding some words of taint. For the speaker is sometimes a man of means, or the like, from whom he receives favors, or who he fears will regard him as unwise, or the like [for remaining silent]. And, therefore, the yetzer will entice him, too, to concur in this. But know, my brother, that this, too, is essentially a transgression of the negative commandment of flattery — even if he adds but a few words — as is explained in the Be'er Mayim Chayim.
 And in this regard it is written (Mishlei 23:2): "And put a knife to your throat [against speaking lashon hara] if you are a man of spirit." And one must rather expose himself to danger than bring his soul to such a sin. According to the Torah, every man under such circumstances must, in any event, strengthen himself not to abet him [the speaker] even by so much as one movement which would cause it to appear that he concurs with what he is saying. And in this connection we can understand the words of Chazal (Eiduyoth 5:6): "It is better to be called a fool all of one's days than to be wicked one moment before the Almighty." And this, even if he knows that his words of reproof will not be accepted by the speaker; for, otherwise, he certainly must reprove him for this, too (as will be explained, G–d willing, in Hilchoth Lashon Hara, Principle VI). 17) And sometimes there is yet another negative commandment which is found to be transgressed (in our many sins) — speaking lashon hara against someone in anger, and, at the same time, cursing him — sometimes even by the Name (even if in the vernacular). In doing so, one transgresses an absolute negative commandment viz. (Vayikra 19:14): "Do not curse a deaf man" (the meaning being "even" a deaf man — how much more so, one who is not deaf, as explained in Choshen Mishpat 27:1).
We have hereby enumerated seventeen negative commandments which are often attendant upon lashon hara and rechiluth — even if he speaks only to a Jew. (For if he slanders a Jew to a non-Jew, the issur is greater and graver, sometimes entering into the category of massur [informing], as we shall explain, G–d willing, in Hilchoth Lashon Hara, Principle VIII). And (transgression of) many of the aforementioned negative commandments are subject to death at the hands of Heaven — such as demeaning a widow or an orphan or profaning the Name. And many of them have implications for the world to come, such as "whitening" the face of one's friend in public or honoring oneself in the shame of his friend. This, in the instance of one who habituates himself to this grave transgression of lashon hara and rechiluth, all of which will be explained below, God willing.  And now I shall begin, with the help of the Blessed L–rd to explain how many positive commandments one transgresses in speaking lashon hara and rechiluth, as we projected above.

One who bears tales against his friend, aside from transgressing the negative commandments we mentioned above, also transgresses several positive commandments, which I shall explain, with the help of the Blessed One, one by one.
(1) He transgresses thereby (Devarim 24:9): "Remember what the L–rd your G–d did to Miriam on the way when you went out of Egypt." The Torah exhorted us hereby that we mention verbally, always, the great punishment [leprosy] that the Blessed L–rd brought upon the tzadeketh, Miriam the prophetess — who spoke only about her brother, whom she loved as her soul, whom she raised on her knees, and for whom she endangered her life, to rescue him from the Nile. And she did not speak in denigration of him, but only compared him to other prophets. And she did not speak so to his face to shame him, and not in public, but only to her brother Aaron, privately. And he [Moses] was not offended by all this, viz. (Bamidbar 12:3): "And the man Moses was extremely humble, more than any man on the face of the earth" — in spite of which all her good deeds did not avail her and she was punished with leprosy for this. How much more so will other people, the fools, who are prolix in speaking "great and awesome things" against their friends, be severely punished for this.  (2) And he [the speaker of lashon hara] also transgresses (Vayikra 19:18): "And you shall love your neighbor as yourself," whereby we have been commanded to be as solicitous for our friend's money as we are for our own, and to be solicitous of his honor, and to speak in his praise, as we are solicitous for our own honor. And if one speaks or receives lashon hara and rechiluth against his friend, though it be true, it is apparent that he does not love him at all — how much more so is he in violation of "as yourself!"
And the great proof of this [that he is in violation of "as yourself"] is as follows: Does not every man know his own shortcomings? — in spite of which he would not want his friend to know, under any circumstances, even one thousandth of them! And even if it happens that a few of his faults become known to his friend, who goes and speaks of them to others — how he stands and waits, wishing the L–rd to grant that they not accept his words and not believe him! And all so that he not be seen in their eyes as unworthy — even though he knows himself to be guilty of very many sins, far more than his friend has revealed. In spite of this, in the access of his self-love, everything is swept away. Thus, exactly in this way must one conduct himself vis-à-vis his friend according to the Torah, to be solicitous of his honor in every respect.
And not in vain did the Torah relate to us the episode of Noach, viz. (Bereshith 9:21-23): "And he drank from the wine and he was inebriated and he uncovered himself in the midst of his tent. And Cham the father of Canaan saw the nakedness of his father and he told his two brothers outside. And Shem and Yefeth took the garment and placed it on the shoulders of both and they covered the nakedness of their father, and their faces were [kept] turned backwards [when they drew near him to cover him], and the nakedness of their father they did not see." And the Torah also relates to us the blessing by which Noach blessed them (viz. Ibid 26-27) and which was ultimately realized — to reveal to us the greatness of this attribute, that one must cover up any unseemliness in his friend with all of his power, just as he would for himself!  (3) And sometimes he also transgresses (Vayikra 19:15): "In righteousness shall you judge your neighbor." For example, if one sees his friend saying something or doing something, which may be perceived as righteous and meritorious or as the reverse, even if he [his friend] is a mediocre person, we are obligated by the Torah in this positive commandment to judge him in the scales of merit. (And if that man is G–d-fearing, we are obligated to judge him in the scales of merit even if they incline more to guilt than to merit.) And one who goes and speaks demeaningly of him because of this thing that he said or that he did, or the receiver [of these words], who perceives him negatively because of what he has heard about him, and does not judge him in the scales of merit, transgresses this positive commandment.  4) And if through his lashon hara or rechiluth he lowers his friend so that he loses his livelihood as a result, as when through evil-heartedness he publicizes his friend as being dishonest, or, if he is a worker, as being unfit for his work, or the like, he also transgresses (Vayikra 25:35): "And if your brother grows poor and his hand falls with you, then you shall uphold him [even if he be], proselyte or sojourner; and he shall live with you." And (Ibid 16): "And your brother shall live with you," whereby we have been commanded to uphold the hand of an Israelite who has fallen ["on hard times,"], either by giving him a gift or a loan, or by going into partnership with him, or by finding a job for him, so that he be strengthened thereby and not fall and be beholden to men. How much more so are we commanded not to cause him to lose his livelihood!  (5) And sometimes, by accepting the lashon hara or the rechiluth, he also transgresses (Ibid 19:16): "Reprove shall you reprove your neighbor." As when he sees his friend beginning to speak demeaningly of another, and he knows that his words [of reproof] will be accepted by his friend (or even if there is a possibility that they will be accepted), the din is that he must reprove him so that the sin not be consummated. Therefore, if he allows him to consummate his lashon hara, he certainly transgresses this positive commandment.(6) And all that we have written applies even if he speaks demeaningly of his friend to him [alone]. But if he joins himself to a company of men of wickedness and speakers of lashon hara in order to speak to them demeaningly of his friend or to hear [such words] from them, he transgresses also (Devarim 10:20): "And to Him shall you cleave," which Chazal explain as cleaving to Torah scholars, frequenting their assemblies in all circumstances — even eating and drinking with Torah scholars and doing business with them and joining them in all types of activities — all this, in order to learn from their deeds. Therefore, certainly, one who does the opposite of this, joining himself to a company of wicked men, transgresses this positive commandment.  7) And all this, even if not in the house of study. But if one speaks lashon hara and rechiluth in the house of study or in the house of prayer, he also transgresses (Vayikra 19:30): "And My sanctuary shall you fear." (Our house of study is included in the category of the sanctuary, as explained by the poskim.) And we have been commanded by this verse to fear the One who resides there, wherefore we may make there only reckonings of mitzvah, such as [those pertaining to] the tzedakah fund and the like. How much more so is it forbidden to engage there in laughter, joking, and idle converse. And this is a categorical prohibition, as explained in Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim 151:11. And even more so is it forbidden to speak there lashon hara or rechiluth, out of fear of the Blessed L–rd who dwells there, aside from the grave issur in itself [of speaking lashon hara]. In speaking thus, one shows himself not to believe that the Holy One Blessed be He reposes His Shechinah in this house — whereby he has the audacity to speak in the house of the King against the will of the King.
And even those who study Torah regularly in the house of study, where they are permitted to eat and drink (as explained in the aforementioned Orach Chaim, section 1), in any event, if they go astray in the issur of laughing and joking or lashon hara and rechiluth in the house of study, they transgress the positive commandment of "My sanctuary shall you fear," aside from the issur itself. As the Magen Avraham wrote (151:2): "Are the Torah scholars not exhorted in respect to fear of the sanctuary? All that was permitted them, perforce, is eating and drinking because they learn in the house of study. If they had to eat and drink outside the house of study, their studies would be interrupted." (As far as converse in general which is not talk of levity for Torah scholars in the house of study, see what we have written with the help of the L–rd in Part Three.)

8) And if the one before whom he spoke lashon hara or rechiluth were an elder and he demeaned him with this to his face, even if he were an elderly ignoramus, he also transgresses (Vayikra 19:32): "And you shall honor the face of the elder." (And even though the "elder" of the verse refers to one who is wise, Chazal have explained that "And you shall honor" also reverts to "the hoary head" (seivah) that precedes it), for "honor" refers to honoring with words, i.e., speaking to him with honor and respect. And if he demeans him, he certainly does not honor him. Likewise, if he is wise, even if he is not elderly, he also transgresses this positive commandment. For the "elder" [zaken] of the verse refers to a sage, as it is expounded: [zaken] "he who has acquired wisdom" (aside from his coming many times to transgress thereby the graver issur of shaming a Torah scholar, thereby entering the category of apikores [heretic] according to the din. We shall enlarge upon this, the L–rd willing.) And if he is an elder and also a sage, he transgresses "And you shall honor" doubly.
9) And if he whom he spoke about were a Cohein, and he demeaned him thus to his face, he also transgresses (Vayikra 21:8): "And you shall sanctify him," whereby we have been exhorted to accord them [the Cohanim] much honor. And since he speaks lashon hara or rechiluth against him and shames him, he certainly does not honor him thereby, and he transgresses.
10) And if he [the one spoken against] were his older brother, or his mother's husband or his father's wife, he also transgresses the positive commandment of "honoring," their having been included [in this mitzvah by the addition of "ve'eth", [(Shemoth 20:12): "Honor your father and [ve'eth] your mother," as explained in Kethuvoth 103a)]. How much more so — if, G–d forbid, [he speaks lashon hara] against his father or mother themselves, where he certainly transgresses the positive commandment of honoring father and mother — [is such lashon hara especially egregious]! Aside from all this, he also transgresses (Devarim 27:16): "Cursed is he who demeans his father and his mother" — may Heaven protect us!
11) And in all instances, he also transgresses (Devarim 6:13): "The L–rd your G–d shall you fear," whereby we have been exhorted to fear the Blessed L–rd all the days of our life. And, when an act [of transgression] comes to hand, we are obligated to arouse our spirit at that time [to the realization that] the Holy One Blessed be He observes the deeds of all men, and "returns them vengeance" according to the evil of the deed; and [in this realization] he will keep from transgressing the will of his Maker. And, of a certainty, one who abandons his soul to this grave transgression of lashon hara and rechiluth violates this positive commandment [of fearing the L–rd].
12) And in all instances, he transgresses at that time of speaking lashon hara and rechiluth, the mitzvah of learning Torah, which is an absolute positive commandment, as explained by the Rambam in (Hilchoth Talmud Torah 1) and in his Sefer Hamitzvoth (Positive Commandments 11) and by all the enumerators of the mitzvoth. And there is no limit to the reward of this mitzvah, which is over and against all of the mitzvoth, as explained in the Mishnah (Peah 1:1) and in Yerushalmi (Ibid). For all of the mitzvoth are not comparable to one pronouncement of Torah. And, conversely, the punishment for its neglect is over and against all of the transgressions, as Chazal have explained (Petichah d'Eichah Rabbati 2): "The Holy One Blessed be He 'overlooked' the sins of idolatry, illicit relations, and the spilling of blood; but He did not overlook the sin of neglect of Torah."
13) And all this that we have discussed until now applies even when he speaks [lashon hara] about his friend that is true; but if within his lashon hara or rechiluth there becomes intermixed something which is partially false, he also transgresses a positive commandment of the Torah, viz. (Shemoth 23:7): "From a thing of falsehood keep far." And his name [i.e., his classification] also changes for the worse thereby, his now being called "motzi shem ra" ("the spreader of a bad name"). And his punishment is far more severe than that for the speaker of lashon hara and rechiluth in general.
14) It also is apparent that [in all eight modes] he also transgresses (Devarim 28:9): "And you shall walk in His ways," whereby we have been commanded to emulate the traits of the Holy One Blessed be He, all of which [traits] are for the good alone, as Chazal have said (Shabbath 133b): "Just as He is merciful, you, too, be merciful; just as He is gracious, you, too, be gracious," and the like with the other good traits, as is explained by the Rambam (Hilchoth Deoth 1:5 and 6). And we find with the Holy One Blessed be He, in His pure and holy traits, that He hates delation [informing] in all modes, even against the most reprehensible of men, as Chazal have said in the episode of Achan [viz. Joshua 7] (Sanhedrin 11a): "Am I [the L–rd] a delator for you?" And He hopes for the good and not for the bad (viz. Tanna d'bei Eliyahu 1), and (Sotah 42a): "Four classes do not behold the Divine Presence: …the class of the speakers of lashon hara, as it is written (Tehillim 5:5): 'For You are not a G–d who desires wickedness, evil shall not dwell with You.'" Therefore, one who habituates himself to this evil trait does not walk in the way of the L–rd, which is only to do good to others, and he does the opposite — wherefore the Torah designated [lashon hara] as "evil" — so that he also transgresses this positive commandment [i.e., "And you shall walk in His ways."]
We have thus enumerated fourteen positive commandments, which tend to be transgressed by lashon hara and rechiluth (aside from the aforementioned seventeen negative commandments). And though all the seventeen negative commandments and fourteen positive commandments cannot obtain with one man and with one slur, as is clear to the reader, still, all who are habituated, G–d forbid, to this evil trait will certainly transgress all of them in the course of time. For sometimes he will come to speak lashon hara against an elder, and sometimes, against a sage. And sometimes he will demean him to his face and sometimes not to his face, as mentioned above.
